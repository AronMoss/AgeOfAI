                <h2> Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the way we live, work, and communicate. But as AI grows more
                    powerful, it raises questions about our rights and the responsibilities of those who create and use
                    it. This project explores how we can balance innovation with fairness, privacy, and ethics.</p>

                <h2>Impact on Society</h2>
                <p>As AI technology advances, its influence reaches into every aspect of our lives - from the way we
                    work and communicate to how we make decisions and solve problems. This technological revolution
                    brings both opportunities and challenges that we must carefully consider.</p>

                <h2>Our Responsibility</h2>
                <p>The development of AI requires careful consideration of ethics, fairness, and human rights. We must
                    ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly, with proper oversight and
                    consideration for all members of society.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are
                    programmed to think and learn like humans. AI can be categorized into various types, including
                    narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general AI, which aims to perform any
                    intellectual task that a human can do.</p>
                <p>AI technologies are transforming industries by enabling machines to perform tasks that typically
                    require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and
                    language translation.</p>

                <h2>Why AI Matters</h2>
                <p>AI is revolutionizing the way we live and work. From healthcare to finance, AI applications are
                    enhancing efficiency, improving outcomes, and driving innovation. Understanding AI is crucial for
                    navigating the future of technology and its impact on society.</p>
